Simple DropBox client for mobile devices. 
The application is meant as an example of how one can use Mono and .Net to write cross-platform mobile applications that runs on iOS, Android and WP7.

The Android version is built on Api version 8 (Android 2.2), the iOS version is built on iOS v 3.2 (yep :-)) and the WP7 version is built on SDK v 7.5.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code.


TODO for the future:
* Test the UI on all devices
* Add icons for files/folders on iOS
* Display other file types than text
* Modify files
* Upload new files
* Save files to local storage
